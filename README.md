# VITYARTHI-PROJECT1
Project Introduction: Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

The Tic-Tac-Toe (Tik Tak) game is a classic two-player board game played on a 3×3 grid. The objective is simple: players take turns marking the grid with ‘X’ and ‘O’, and the first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

This Python project aims to recreate the Tic-Tac-Toe experience using basic programming concepts. It helps beginners understand, conditionals, lists, functions loops, and user input handling. The game runs in the console and allows two players to compete by entering their moves through keyboard input.

Developing this project improves problem-solving skills and introduces the idea of checking winning conditions, validating moves, and managing game flow. The result is a clean, interactive Python program that demonstrates core logic-building techniques in a fun way.

🎯 Problem Statement: Command-Line Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The objective is to design and implement a complete, two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses) that runs in a command-line interface.
Key Requirements:
 * Game Board Representation: The system must use a suitable data structure (like a list or array) to represent the 3x3 game board, allowing for easy indexing and state tracking.
 * User Interface: The game must clearly display the current state of the board after every move, making it simple for players to understand where to place their mark.
 * Player Input & Validation: The system must accept input from two human players (conventionally 'X' and 'O') for their moves. The input must be validated to ensure:
   * The position entered is within the valid range (1-9).
   * The selected position is currently empty on the board.
 * Game Logic: The system must correctly determine the next player's turn and accurately check for the end of the game after every move:
   * Win Condition: Identify if a player has achieved a winning configuration (three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal).
   * Draw Condition: Determine if all 9 squares are filled without a winner.
 * Conclusion: The game must announce the winner ('X' or 'O') or declare a tie when the game concludes.
